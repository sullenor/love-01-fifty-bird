# Fifty Bird

It is an implementation of the [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) game with [Love2d](https://love2d.org) engine. I made this game as a part of the "CS50's Introduction to Game Development" course.

## How to

Install Love2d:
```
brew install --cask love
```

Start the game:
```
love .
```
